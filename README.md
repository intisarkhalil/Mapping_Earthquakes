# Mapping Earthquakes
In this project we used Leaflet and GeoJSON to visually display Earthquake data on three maps: Street Map, Satellite Map and, Dark Map.
## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to visually show the earthquake data all over the world for the last 7days, in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. 
## Methodology:
To complete this project, we used a GeoJSON earthquake data [Data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson) from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. And then:
1.	Add Tectonic Plate Data.
2.	Add Major Earthquake Data
    -	Pass the tectonic plate data to the ```geoJSON()``` layer.
    -	```Style``` the lines with a color and ```weight``` that will make it stand out on all maps.
    -	Add the tectonic layer group variable you created in Step 1 to the map, i.e., ```.addTo(tectonicPlates)``` and close the ``` geoJSON() ``` layer.
    -	Next, add the tectonic layer group variable to the map, i.e, ``` tectonicPlates.addTo(map) ```. 
    -	Finally, close the ```cd3.json()``` callback.

3.	Add an Additional Map.
We add a Dark map using MapBox styles Map (```dark-v10```).
## Results and Summary:
When you load the page, it defaults to the Streets view with both the Earthquakes and Tectonic Plate overlays engaged. The legend shows you the color coding for various magnitudes.
